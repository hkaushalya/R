A) simple project:
1. Count number of occurances of Quark/W/Z boson, photon,Higgs in CDF notes
2. Can you guess the title by looking at these key words frequency! at least some of the words in the title
2.1 May the words found in the Introduction/Results can be weighted more for this


B) Categorize each as SM/SUSY based on the words used in the note
1. Use SUSY/SM notes for training a tree and predic a note 
2. May be I can try using only the abstract first. Then the whole note.
3. Then reduce the information from only the first line in the abstract( or title)
